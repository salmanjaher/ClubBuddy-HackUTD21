# HackUTD 2021: ClubBuddy

## Inspiration...

All of us have struggled with finding a good online source for learning and keeping up with UTD clubs that we are interested in. The only available source offered by UTD is presence.io which is outdated and very hard to use. As a result, we decided to create "Club Buddy."

## What it does...

Our website acts as a user-friendly way for UTD students to find a collective list of all UTD clubs as well as compile a list of their favorite clubs. It also has an Admin function for club presidents to create and post announcements for their club i.e. Next meeting date, time, and other info.

## How we built it...

As a collective group of four, we were able to divide up the work based on specialization and utilized languages like CSS, HTML, JavaScript, React, git, and tool kits like Tailwind CSS. We created the program by using VS Code and pushing and pulling code through GitHub.

## Challenges we ran into...

Learning to use Tailwind and integrating CSS in React apps was a struggle for us, made worse by very vague error messages, but we learned a lot by overcoming these challenges. Additionally, dividing the work among team members with very varying amounts of experience in React was a challenge, but as a result, we all learned a lot about the framework and are more prepared to use it in the future.

## Accomplishments we are proud of...

Honestly, we are proud that we participated in our first-ever hackathon and were able to come up with such an innovative idea for such a personal problem. We are proud of being able to learn some languages and come up with adaptive solutions to some of the problems we ran into while coding this project.

## What we learned...

How to effectively merge git branches from multiple people contributing simultaneously, and resolve merge conflicts. Languages like HTML, CSS, and toolkits such as Tailwind CSS, as well as effectively using VS Code. Furthermore, we learned a lot about the React framework and how to leverage it to create a successful single page app.

## What is next for Club Buddy...

- RSS Feed for announcements
- More robust database backend
- Streamlined favoriting feature
- Future event handling
